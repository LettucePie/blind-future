# blind-future
A game meant for visibly-impaired people with phones.

## Main Concept
A game in a techno-future, maybe even digital reality. Within this reality there is no sight, only sound and feeling. This game would have no graphics, and would be made to run on mobile. It would work best with stereo wireless headphones/earbuds. The player navigates a virual landscape by using physical gestures while holding the phone, utilizing the accelerometer/gyro. Feedback would be provided by sound and vibration. It is important that navigation is NOT within a 3D space, for doing that would likely be a discomforting experience. The gameplay would be mostly still, interactions and puzzle solving being the core experience.

## Implementation Examples
- Player searches a forest area for a bird.
  - The Player is immersed in sounds of bugs, leaves, and a distant waterfall.
  - The input of tilts and lifts would move a sort of virual cursor in a 2D space.
  - As the Virtual Cursor moves closer to the bird, the birds sound is more clear, and the device vibrates.

- Player engages a sort of ship or engine.
  - The Player is immersed in sounds of a highly technical space ship.
  - Tilting the phone forward would increase speed, however an additional distortive effect grows more violent if held too long. Tilting back calms it down.

## Concerns / worries
- Offensive?
  - Could it be considered rude making "blind challenges"?
- Gryoscope misalignments
- Installation
  - How does a blind person even install a new app, let alone launch it?
  - How and where would one advertise to a blind target audience?
- Physical Danger
  - With Stereo headphones being important, real-life alarms could be missed.
  - Physical Gestures means an open space away from sharp or hazardous objects is required.
